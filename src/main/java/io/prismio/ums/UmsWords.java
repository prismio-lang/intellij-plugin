/**
 * What the manifest's identifiers mean.
 *
 * <p>None of these are keywords — {@code ums/parser/} emits a plain identifier
 * for every one, and the meaning is added by {@code ums/model/lowering.psm}. The
 * tables here mirror that file so the editor recognises exactly what the
 * compiler recognises, and colours nothing it would reject.
 *
 * <p>Each entry carries its own description because completion, documentation
 * and the annotator all want the same sentence, and three copies of it drift.
